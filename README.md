# SEA Complex

These scripts demonstrate the use of [IMP](http://salilab.org/imp), [MODELLER](http://salilab.org/modeller), 
[PMI](https://github.com/salilab/pmi) in the modeling of the SEA complex using 188 DSS chemical cross-links and 23 affinity purification data.

First, [MODELLER](http://salilab.org/modeller) is used to generate
initial structures for the individual components where reliable templates are available. Then, IMP
is used to model these components using the DSS/EDC crosslinks and the affinity purification data for the entire SEA complex.


A full description of the scripts can be found in
[Molecular architecture and function of the SEA complex, a modulator of the TORC1 pathway](http://mcponline.org/content/early/2014/07/29/mcp.M114.039388).

## List of files and directories:

- `pdb`	contains all input structures that were generated by MODELLER or deposited in PDB.

- `scripts`
  - `sj_SEA_multi_layers.py`                   The main modeling script with 1:3 stoichiometry and rotational symmetry

  - `chimera_scripts/sea_density.cmd`          Chimera script to view all localization density files 


- `outputs/pdbs`    the production will write the best scoring models into pdb files they are initialized and then updated as long as the calculation goes
                 (They are the best 500 models, so at the beginning they are empty, since you haven't start the calculation yet)

- `outputs/rmfs`    the production will write the rmf3 files for lowest temperature replica.
			
- `stat.n.out`	 log files. They contain all relevant numbers of the calculation.
